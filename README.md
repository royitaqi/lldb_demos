# lldb_demos
A series of demos when learning and working with LLDB


## pull_dsym

How a shell script can be used to resolve UUIDs into dsym files when LLDB requests such dsym files.

## dylib

When does LLDB request dsyms for dylibs: at target creation time, execution time, or when the execution enters the dylib?
